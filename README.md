**Project Name: Telcom Churn Analysis**

## Overview
This project aims to analyze customer churn in a telecommunication company based on demographic data, services, and customer information. The dataset used for analysis contains information about customers, their contract types, payment methods, internet services, monthly charges, and other relevant details.

## Findings

1. **Gender Impact**: After performing a groupby analysis, it was observed that the number of churn customers among males and females is quite similar. Therefore, gender does not appear to have a significant impact on churn rates.

2. **Partner's Influence**: Customers who do not have partners are more likely to churn compared to those with partners.

3. **Most Profitable Contract Type**: The analysis indicates that the month-to-month contract type is the most profitable for the company.

4. **Payment Method and Churn**: The specific payment method that is likely to have churn customers is not mentioned in the available data. Further investigation is required to determine this.

5. **Internet Service and Churn**: The internet service most likely to have churn customers is not specified in the data. Additional analysis is needed to answer this question.

6. **Monthly Charges and Churn**: Churn customers tend to have lower monthly charges on average, according to the analysis.

7. **Monthly Charges by Contract Type**: The relationship between monthly charges and contract type is not provided in the available information. Further exploration is required to address this question.

8. **TechSupport Impact**: Customers without tech support are more likely to churn, as indicated by the analysis.

9. **Dependents' Influence**: Customers without dependents are more likely to churn based on the analysis.

10. **Most Profitable Service Type**: The most profitable service type is not specified in the provided data. Further analysis is needed to determine this.

## Repository Structure

- `notebooks/`: Jupyter notebooks used for data exploration, visualization, and analysis.
- `reports/`: This directory holds any generated reports, summaries, or charts.
- `README.md`: This file provides an overview of the project, its findings, and how to replicate the analysis.

## Reproducing the Analysis

To reproduce the analysis, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`.
3. Navigate to the `notebooks/` directory.
4. Run the Jupyter notebooks in the numerical order to see the step-by-step analysis.
5. Each notebook will produce visualizations and insights related to specific questions.
6. Refer to the results in each notebook to understand the findings.

## Conclusion

This Telcom Churn Analysis project aims to provide insights into customer churn behavior based on various factors. The findings suggest that certain factors, such as partner status, dependents, and tech support, can influence customer churn. Additionally, the month-to-month contract type appears to be the most profitable for the company. For further analysis and in-depth understanding, additional data and more sophisticated models could be explored.
